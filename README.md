# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Getting Started with Giga's website ‚ÑπÔ∏è #

This repo contains the source code for Giga's redesigned and redevloped website using React.js, CSS, SCSS and a headless CMS, Strapi,  for Content Management by using their pre-built APIs.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Available scripts for the front-end ‚ÑπÔ∏è ##

In the "giga-website" project directory, you can run the following commands to start viewing the website's front-end:

### `npm start` üöÄ

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` üß™

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` üß∞

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
 
### `npm run eject` ‚èèÔ∏è

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Getting started with Strapi's CMS ‚ÑπÔ∏è #

Strapi is a headless CMS which I've used to function as an admin panel to manage the website's content to make it easier to create, read, update and delete the websites' content that is being displayed without having to edit the code.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Available scripts for Strapi ‚ÑπÔ∏è ##

Strapi comes with a full featured Command Line Interface (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds. In the "strapi-giga" project directory, you can run the following commands to start viewing/editing the website's content management system:

### `develop` üöÄ

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

```
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

### `start` üé¨

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-start)

```
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

### `build` üß∞

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-build)

```
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Deployment ‚öôÔ∏è
